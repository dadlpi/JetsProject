# JetsProject
This is project that ties a lot of the curriculum that we have studied so far, however there is a deep emphasis on having classes reference Abstract classes by extending their members to inheriting classes. Also heavy emphasis is placed using Interface classes that are implemented by child classes. The challenge was to be able to not only create these objects but handle them in various scenarios by calling them from a Class that instantiates these objects (where they are not in the class that holds the main method) challenging the developer to think more in an Object Oriented Manner.

# Description
The JetsApp is meant to collect various types of airplanes that could be on a airfield at any moment in time, where numbers of airplanes can increase or decrease on an airfield. Also, important information about the airplanes can be returned to the standard output (console) and we can also simulate calling on each category of airplane's specific actions by calling specific airplane categories and having them perform their action (unique method).

# Tecnologies Used
-Java version 8
-Eclipse IDE
-Object Oriented Programming

# Lessons Learned
Although from the Skill Distillery lectures the topics registered in my mind as individual topics, applying the concepts helped tie in how all the Java concepts work together when actually writing code to build an object oriented application. Scoping and calling on other objects was less of an issue this time however the more challenging topic for me was how to make code less repetitive.
